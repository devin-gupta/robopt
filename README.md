# Decentralized Task Allocation for Robotic Swarms Using Bidding Mechanisms

## Problem Statement

The strategic coordination of multi-agent systems, particularly robotic swarms, presents a significant challenge in the development of generalizable robotic systems [OH23]. In real-world scenarios, coordinating multiple robots to achieve high-level objectives efficiently requires advanced strategies that can handle various constraints such as limited resources, robot heterogeneity, and potential adversarial conditions.

### Proposal Overview

This project proposes a **novel framework** for decentralized task distribution within robotic swarm systems, using a **bidding mechanism** that allows each robot to bid on tasks dynamically based on its current state and capabilities. The overarching goal is to ensure **efficient resource allocation** and **task execution** by enabling robots to autonomously choose tasks they are most suited for, while considering factors like energy consumption and task completion time.

The framework will be grounded in **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)**, enabling robots to learn optimal bidding strategies over time. The system will continuously adapt based on the robots' abilities, real-time state data, and task rewards, with the following core objectives:

- **Minimize Task Completion Time**: Distribute tasks efficiently among robots to reduce the overall time required for task execution.
- **Minimize Energy Consumption**: Allocate tasks in a way that optimizes energy usage, which is particularly critical in scenarios like disaster relief or space exploration.
- **Handle Robot Heterogeneity**: Account for the different capabilities and limitations of each robot in the swarm, ensuring fair and effective task distribution.
- **Robustness to Adversarial Agents**: Ensure the system is resistant to potential malicious agents within the swarm, maintaining robustness and reliability in various environments.

### Applications

The proposed decentralized bidding framework is versatile and scalable, making it suitable for a variety of real-world applications, including:

- **Warehouse Management**: Autonomous robots can efficiently pick, sort, and transport items based on real-time state and capability assessments.
- **Disaster Relief**: Swarms of robots can autonomously divide and execute search-and-rescue missions, optimizing resource usage while minimizing task completion time.
- **Space Exploration**: Multi-robot systems can perform tasks such as planetary exploration, material collection, or habitat construction, with energy efficiency being a key consideration.

### Key Components

1. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**: Each robot learns how to optimally bid on tasks based on its state and capabilities.
2. **Decentralized Bidding Mechanism**: Robots submit bids for tasks autonomously, with task allocation based on the highest bid and utility provided by each robot.
3. **Task Allocation and Utility Function**: A task allocation function determines the most appropriate robot-task pairings, ensuring fairness and efficiency.
4. **Robot Heterogeneity**: The framework adapts to diverse robotic capabilities, ensuring that more capable robots handle complex tasks, while less capable robots take on simpler tasks.
5. **Scalability and Robustness**: The system is designed to scale effectively to large swarms and handle adversarial conditions.

### Goals and Outcomes

The primary outcome of this project is a scalable, interpretable, and efficient system for robotic swarm task allocation. The framework will reduce task completion times, optimize energy usage, and improve robustness to adversarial conditions. With a decentralized approach, the system will be adaptable to various industries and environments where robotic swarms are used.
